    <p>This site is designed to guide new students which are passionate about applying their knowledge to the practical life. A new comer or <i>noobs</i> with little bit of idea and lot of motivation to learn but usually they get bored off after 3-4 days.</p>
    <p>So one of our founders<b> Mr. Aayush Paikra</b> worked on it that why people loose interest on courses after watching videos and learning a lot from internet.And finally he came up with the conclusion that doing a job without any target or goal is the main reason behind loosing interest.So ,<b>Noobtech</b> provides a platform for all those undirectional students with goals so that they can be energised again when they see they can apply the knowledge they have gained so far. </p>
    <p>This platform also provide a noob about ideas and give information of many components that they may not heard before.</p>
